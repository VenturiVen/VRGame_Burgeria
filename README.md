# CS4071_VRGame
Project for module CS4071 - Virtual and Augmented Reality Design.

This game is inspired by simulator-like VR games such as Job Simulator, but also non-VR games such as Papa's Burgeria.

Currently, the objective is to simply make as many burgers as you want until you get bored.

Note: Tested on an Oculus Quest 2
